## Purpose:

Maps the latin alphabet + arabic numbers into a new set of "encrypt_symbols". Each encrypt_symbol is comprised of n special_symbols.

special_symbols = [! " # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . : ; < = > ? [ \ ] ^ _ { | } a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]

## Executing the program:

Use python or python3 command depending on your installation:

Command to execute program: python basic_encryption_scheme.py

## Future implementation ideas:

> Saves the encrypt_symbols in a file and takes the user's password. Using command-line arguments, allows the user to input their normal password and convert it to its encrypted form.
> If the user wants, they can generate a new list of encrypt_symbols
> *Do not save the user's password, convert it during runtime so they can copy/paste it*
> *Backup the encrypt key somehow???*
